## New York language familiy

### Introduction

This language family serves as an example/case-study to demonstrate multi-language static analysis.

### Involved languages

There are three languages involved in this project:
- `manhattan` is the new incarnation of the `mod` language, with string literals added to id.
- `brooklyn` is a SQL substrate that currently only provides `CREATE TABLE (...)` statements.
- `canarsie` is the part of the statix spec that both languages share.

### Project layout

This project follows the spoofax 3 layout (as it was in June 23, 2020).
Firstly, the `*.spoofaxcore` projects are regular spoofax 2 project, but built using gradle.
