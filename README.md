# Statix Sandbox

This repository is a collection of experiments of language definition with the Spoofax language workbench, primarily to test the Statix meta-language for static semantics definition.

The `modules` and `paris` projects define a language with modules and records following the examples from the ESOP'15 and PEPM'16 work on [scope graphs](http://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/research/projects/scope-graphs/) and constraint-based type checking, but using the Statix language from the OOPSLA'18 paper.

The projects were driven to provide examples for various talks:

- [Statix: Declarative Type System Specification](https://eelcovisser.org/talks/2019/02/19/declarative-type-system-specification-with-statix/) (Portland, Feb 2019)
- [Type Checkers from Declarative Type System Specifications in Statix](https://eelcovisser.org/talks/2020/02/20/type-checkers-in-statix/) (Paris, Feb 2020)
